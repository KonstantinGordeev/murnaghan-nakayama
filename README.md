# Murnaghan-Nakayama rule with Python

Code for calculation character values and tables of symmetric groups using [Murnaghan–Nakayama rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murnaghan–Nakayama_rule). This code implements a recurrent version of the algorithm with caching of characteristic values and permutations. There is also a method for calculating the entire character table.

You can read more about the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule in the book [Richard Stanley, Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol. 2](https://books.google.ru/books?id=7-OXjgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y).
